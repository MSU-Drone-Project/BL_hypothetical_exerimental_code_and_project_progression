## objectives
Ment to be an example of a project progression checklist and interconnects


### spin motor 
Motor selected is 3 phase.
Motors are spun with ESCs(electronic speed controlers) with servo commands via GPIO pins.

sucess with ardurino uno 
although no control more investagation needed.
more investigation into calbration of ESCs

Was looking in to jetson nano then asked on its forum for pwm commands.
Seems it was normal to control them via micro controler. 

**to be continued**

### basic setup of jetson nano
**current objective** boot up and understand jetson nano
todo


### read from sensors
 to read from sensor to obtain numerical output from direct connect to jetson nano.

todo

### microcontroler and microcomputer communication 
verify controled data input and integerity on the other device 2 way. 
although, 1 way might only be needed.
todo

### wifi communication to controler
controler selection needed or app

verify controled data input and integerity on the other device 2 way. 
although, 1 way might only be needed.

todo

### balanced flight
function interaction basied on sensor inputs to calbrate balanced flight
no propeller tilt test

todo

### read from extra sensors

elevation from pressure caluculation
dew point from calculation
data read

need to consider data output device


todo

### camera output
might need a screen
compatable cammera required
standard visual spectrum and ifrared camera 
get raw image 
Machine learning and/or deep learning might be interesting
