# BL_hypothetical_exerimental_code_and_project_progression


## objectives
Ment to be an example of a project progression checklist and interconnects

### selected motor and powering it
select a motor and power it

selected motor was 4S
 S = 3.7V
 
 battery selection for motor
 4S lipo
 
 3 wires from motor ment 3 phase
 addtional interface required
 research produced that ESC's are required electronic speed controler
 
 power distrobution to 4 motors required 
 power distrobutsion board obtained
 
 **completed**

### spin motor 
Motor selected is 3 phase.
Motors are spun with ESCs(electronic speed controlers) with servo commands via GPIO pins.

sucess with ardurino uno 
although no control more investagation needed.
more investigation into calbration of ESCs

Was looking in to jetson nano then asked on its forum for pwm commands.
Seems it was normal to control them via micro controler. 

**to be continued**

### basic setup of jetson nano

boot up and understand jetson nano

**completed**


~~### read from sensors
 to read from sensor to obtain numerical output from direct connect to jetson nano.
 I2C interface~~

**changed to slaved Audrino nano 33 ble sense**

### microcontroler and microcomputer communication 
verify controled data input and integerity on the other device 2 way. 
although, 1 way might only be needed...

Audrino nano 33 ble sense is selected for reduction incomplexity.
 
** current task **

### wifi communication to controler
controler selection needed or app or micro controler

verify controled data input and integerity on the other device 2 way. 
although, 1 way might only be needed.

*major task*

**todo**

### balanced flight
function interaction basied on sensor inputs to calbrate balanced flight
no propeller tilt test

*major task*

todo

### read from extra sensors

elevation from pressure caluculation
dew point from calculation
data read

*extra item*

need to consider data output device


todo

### camera output
might need a screen
compatable cammera required
standard visual spectrum and ifrared camera 
get raw image 
Machine learning and/or deep learning might be interesting 

*extra item*
