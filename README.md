## objectives
Ment to be an example of a project progression checklist and interconnects


### spin motor 
Motor selected is 3 phase.
Motors are spun with ESCs(electronic speed controlers) with servo commands via GPIO pins.

sucess with ardurino uno 
although no control more investagation needed.
more investigation into calbration of ESCs

Was looking in to jetson nano then asked on its forum for pwm commands.
Seems it was normal to control them via micro controler. 

**to be continued**

### read from sensors
**current objective** to read from sensor to obtain numerical output from direct connect to jetson nano.
